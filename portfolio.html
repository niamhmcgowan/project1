    <p>Hello, my name is Cleo Mary J Medeus. I live in New jersey. I was born in Haiti but grew up in the Dominican republic. 
        <br>I love the color pink, purple, beige, brown, and everything in between. I love to eat good food, boba tea and hanging out with my friends and family. 
        <br>My favorite movie of all time is the trilogy and prequel of the lord of the rings mov and moana. 
        <br>I love to skate in my free time and I love art.</p>
